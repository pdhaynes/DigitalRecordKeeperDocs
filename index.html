        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Digital Record Keeper App is a secure and easily accessible repository for sensitive user files and documents.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Encrypted</h2>
        <p>
            All files are secured with military grade AES encryption and have unique keys generated on a per file basis.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Only Downside is Complete Ownership
        </h2>
        <p>
            The user has the ultimate control and ownership over all files. The app simply serves as an encryption medium for sensitive user data, This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All information is stored and encrypted locally on YOUR device.</li>
            <li>Files/encryption keys are <b>NOT</b> stored in remote locations, such as the cloud.</li>
            <li>File access passwords are hashed and stored <b>locally</b> in an encrypted Database</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>This sounds great, where is the a downside?</h4>
        <p>
            Since the user is given complete control, we do not have access to any of the data you store. This means we are unable to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Reset File Passwords</b></li>
            <li><b>Reset User Passwords</b></li>
            <li><b>Decrypt Files</b></li>
            <li><b>Retrieve Encryption Keys</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While this may sound scary at first, we are committed to enabling the user to "help themselves" as many ways as feasibly possible.
